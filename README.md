# rubiks
Project for APS360. Machine learning approach to solving the Rubik's Cube. 

THIS IS A CHANGE

## dataset
* contains Rubik's cube state and solve information. training#.txt contains a state and sequence of moves
to get to a solved cube. trainingseq#.txt contains the state after each turn. 

## __tests__
* contains tests for functions. Ensure before uploading that you have both written your own test function, 
and your code successfully runs all other tests. 

## src
* contains all source files for our project. 
### src/model
* contains the model (and additional tools) for our machine learning networks. 
### src/rubiks 
* contains code for defining the rubiks game. 
### src/ui
* contains code for user interfacing/visualization 

## tools 
* Folder for the scripts used for testing/development.

## main.py 
* main application for final app
## run_tests.py
* runs all unit tests. RUN THIS BEFORE PUSHING TO ORIGIN, ENSURE IT WORKS
## training.ipynb 
* contains scripts used for training the model
