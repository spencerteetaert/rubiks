THIS IS A CHANGE

## dataset
* contains Rubik's cube state and solve information. training#.txt contains a state and sequence of moves
to get to a solved cube. trainingseq#.txt contains the state after each turn.

## src
* contains all source files for our project. 
### src/model
* contains the model (and additional tools) for our machine learning networks. 
### src/rubiks

## tools 
* Folder for the scripts used for testing/development.

## main.py
